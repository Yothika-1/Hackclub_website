    <h2>What is the government doing to address this issue?</h2>
    <p>Human trafficking is not a problem of a group, community or province. It is a problem that is affecting the whole nation making it a matter of concern at the federal level. The following are 5 main pillars the Canadian government uses in its National Strategy plan to address this issue:</p>
    <h3>Empowerment</h3>
    <p>- The government will provide victims with tools to regain their independence and dignity. </p>
    <p>- The goal is to empower youth and vulnerable individuals to protect themselves and try innovative interventions to support victims. </p>
    <h4>Key activities include:</h4>
    <p>1) Establishing an advisory committee → This committee will consist of human trafficking victims and survivors and acts like a place where they can discuss their experiences and provide recommendations to the Canadian government in developing an anti-human trafficking society. These recommendations can include policies, campaigns, initiatives, awareness speeches, etc.
    </p>
    <p>2) Encouraging industry partners in implementing chances in their supply chains to prevent the risk of forced labor in government production supply chains.</p>
    <p>3) Building centralized websites → Create a secured website to raise awareness and learn more about human trafficking and funding those who are looking for financial aid for their anti-human trafficking initiative(s).  
    </p>
    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>- The government wants to increase public awareness and build “capacity” in strategic areas to prevent trafficking. 
    </p>
    <h4>Key activities include:</h4>
    <p>National public awareness campaign → Launching a national public awareness campaign will be extremely helpful in educating the people and increasing awareness among large masses of people. 
    </p>
    <p>Enhancing data collection and research → By improving the data collection and research, we can understand the information more effectively and help in closing the gaps. 
    </p>
    <h3>Protection</h3>
    <p>The government will take new initiatives and strategies to protect victims. 
    </p>
    <h4>Key activities include:</h4>
    Establishing a national case-management standard → Giving special focus to vulnerable youth, girls, Indigenous people, LGBTQ+, etc to prevent further trafficking and to ensure that the victims have access to services that address their specific needs and assist them in their recovery and healing.
<p>Enhancing capacity under the Victims of Trafficking in Persons program → Helps in detecting human trafficking suspects through immigration. 
</p>
<h3>Prosecution </h3>
<p>Measures will be taken to improve how law enforcement officers and prosecutors understand and handle human trafficking cases. 
</p>
<h4>Key activities include:</h4>
<p>1) Hosting an international conference → This conference will bring together national and international experts from law enforcement, provincial and territorial government officials, academia, front-line workers, as well as Indigenous partners, non-governmental organizations, and survivors of human trafficking to discuss ways to improve Canada’s criminal justice system response to human trafficking cases. 
</p>
<p>2) Dedicating an expert group of border officials → This is a way to strengthen the strategies that we have to tackle human trafficking. 
</p>
<h3>Partnerships</h3>
<p>Different levels of governments in Canada work together and share responsibilities about protecting and helping victims. 
</p>
<h4>Key activities include:</h4>
<p>1) Hosting annual stakeholder gatherings and outreach meetings → The government will engage private and non-profit sectors to best address emerging trends like the increasing use of technology in this crime, and incorporating a results-based focus to report on the progress of initiatives under the National Strategy. This will ensure the prompt identification of emerging trends in human trafficking and an ever-evolving federal approach.
</p>
<h2>What are the possible alternative actions to deal with this issue?</h2>
<h4>Providing basic financial support to the vulnerable </h4>
<p>- Poverty is one of the leading reasons why people are becoming vulnerable and forcing them to make wrong decisions. So, if the government provides a minimum financial aid, people will be less likely to do unethical actions like giving sexual favors in return for money, etc. </p>

/>
<h4>Stronger legal framework</h4>
<p>- The human trafficking rate is increasing rapidly in Canada due to the fact that there is not enough jail time and a poor legal frame work. According to the Criminal code offenses, a trafficker can get a maximum of 14 years prison time and a minimum mandatory of 4 years penalty in other cases (Government of Canada, 2022). However, in my opinion this is not a fair punishment and the government must increase the number of years imprisoned from 14 years to a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 40 years imprisonment based on the severity of the case.  </p>

/>
<h4>Educate children</h4>
<p>-  The Federal government can also make a lesson/chapter about human trafficking mandatory in all high schools across Canada to raise awareness in prevention and how to act if you are the victim. This is especially important and effective because these kids make the future and when they are informed, they can help reduce the crime. </p>
